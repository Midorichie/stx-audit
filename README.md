## Overview
The STX Wallet Security Audit Tool is a Python-based utility designed to perform security audits on Stacks (STX) blockchain wallets. It analyzes various aspects of wallet activity and configuration to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

## Features
- Balance checking: Identifies unusually large balances that might indicate high-value targets.
- Transaction history analysis: Examines recent transactions for suspicious patterns.
- Smart contract interaction analysis: Detects and reports on interactions with smart contracts.
- Network security checks: Ensures the wallet is interacting with the intended Stacks network.
- Comprehensive reporting: Generates detailed reports with vulnerability severity ratings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library
